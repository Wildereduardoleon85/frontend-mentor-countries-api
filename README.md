# Frontend-mentor-countries-api
This is a project based on the challenge "countries api" from the frontend mentor web site (https://www.frontendmentor.io/), you can see my live site solution here: https://wilder-leon-countries-api.netlify.app/

If you want to rebuild the project in your local machine, simply clone the repository, go to the root directory, open the terminal and type the command: "npm install", and then "npm run dev".
